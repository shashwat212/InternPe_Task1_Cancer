# Breast Cancer Detection Prediction

A machine learning project focused on analyzing medical diagnostic data and building a predictive model to classify tumors as **Malignant** or **Benign** based on cell characteristics.  
The project demonstrates the application of data preprocessing, feature engineering, and classification algorithms in healthcare analytics.
